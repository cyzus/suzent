# Asset License: Proprietary / All Rights Reserved

While the source code of **Suzent** is open source (Apache 2.0), the visual identity—specifically the **Robot Avatar** and its associated animations—are proprietary works.

## Protected Assets

The following assets and their visual implementations are **NOT** covered by the Apache 2.0 license:

- **The Robot Avatar Character:** Including all visual designs, variants, and character-specific code.
- **Brand Identity:** Including the project logo, banner, and unique animation choreography associated with the character.

These assets are primarily located in, but not limited to:
- `frontend/src/components/chat/RobotAvatar.tsx`
- `frontend/src/robot-animations.css`
- `frontend/src/styles.css` (Robot-specific keyframes)
- `docs/assets/*`

## License Terms

**Copyright © 2026 Yizhou Chi. All Rights Reserved.**

### Usage Rights

1.  **Personal Use:** You are permitted to use the Suzent software containing these assets for your own personal, non-commercial use.
2.  **No Redistribution:** You may not extract, redistribute, or use these assets in any other project, codebase, artwork, or product.
3.  **Forks:** If you fork this codebase to create a derivative project (publicly or commercially), **you must replace the Robot Avatar and its animations with your own assets.** You may not use the Suzent Robot Avatar to represent your fork.

### Why this distinction?
This model (similar to Firefox or VS Code) allows the code to remain fully open and free (Apache 2.0) while protecting the project's unique "Brand Identity" from impersonation or confusion.
